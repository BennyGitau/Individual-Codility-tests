### Question 3
This questison is solved by the use of for loop that iterates over the number and reduces the number to print three-digits numbers in decreasing order (999, 998, 997, ..., 101, 100).

### Question 4
The solution is provided by a function that takes in a number;
* Converts the number to a string,
* Splits the number to individual characters,
* Reverses the characters,
* Join the characters into one string
* Strictly compares the the original number with the reversed number and return true if its palindrome

### Question 5
The test is to return a string without the repeated words.
The function takes a string;
* converts the string into individual words using split methods
* Initializes an empty object to keep track of words that are not repeated.
* Filters the words to check the for the repeated words.
* If a word is not repeated it is included in the object and if it is repeated it is omitted.

### Question 6
This function returns a string of numbers and sorts them
The function takes in an array of arrays;
* Flattens the array using reduce and concat methods
* Sorts the numbers using in ascending order using the sort method.
